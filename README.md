# BCnEncoder.NET
A Cross-platform BCn / DXT encoding libary for .NET

# What is it?
BCnEncoder.NET is a library for compressing rgba images to different block-compressed formats. It has no native dependencies and is .NET Standard 2.1 compatible.

Supported formats are:
 - Raw unsigned byte R, RG, RGB and RGBA formats
 - BC1 (S3TC DXT1)
 - BC2 (S3TC DXT3)
 - BC3 (S3TC DXT5)
 - BC4 (RGTC1)
 - BC5 (RGTC2)
 - BC7 (BPTC)

# Current state
The current state of this library is in development but quite usable. I'm planning on implementing support for more codecs and 
different algorithms. The current version is capable of encoding and decoding BC1-BC5 and BC7 images in both KTX or DDS formats.

Please note, that the API might change between versions.
# Dependencies
Current dependencies are:
* [Microsoft.Toolkit.HighPerformance](https://github.com/windows-toolkit/WindowsCommunityToolkit) licenced under the [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) licence for Span2D and Memory2D types.

# Image library extensions
This library has extension packages available for the following image libraries:

[ImageSharp](https://www.nuget.org/packages/BCnEncoder.Net.ImageSharp/)

The extension packages provide extension methods for ease of use with the image library.

# Upgrading to 2.0

If you're upgrading from 1.X.X to version 2, expect some of your exsting code to be broken. ImageSharp was removed as a core dependency in version 2.0, so the code will no longer work with ImageSharp's Image types by default. You can install the extension package for ImageSharp to continue using this library easily with ImageSharp apis.

# API
The below examples are using the ImageSharp extension package. For more detailed usage examples, you can go look at the unit tests. 

Here's an example on how to encode a png image to BC1 without alpha, and save it to a file.
```CSharp
using Image<Rgba32> image = Image.Load<Rgba32>("example.png");

BcEncoder encoder = new BcEncoder();

encoder.OutputOptions.GenerateMipMaps = true;
encoder.OutputOptions.Quality = CompressionQuality.Balanced;
encoder.OutputOptions.Format = CompressionFormat.Bc1;
encoder.OutputOptions.FileFormat = OutputFileFormat.Ktx; //Change to Dds for a dds file.

using FileStream fs = File.OpenWrite("example.ktx");
encoder.EncodeToStream(image, fs);
```

And how to decode a compressed image from a KTX file and save it to png format.
```CSharp
using FileStream fs = File.OpenRead("compressed_bc1.ktx");

BcDecoder decoder = new BcDecoder();
using Image<Rgba32> image = decoder.DecodeToImageRgba32(fs);

using FileStream outFs = File.OpenWrite("decoding_test_bc1.png");
image.SaveAsPng(outFs);
```
